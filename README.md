## ðŸ§  Clustering Techniques Used

1. **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)**  
   - Captures clusters of varying shapes
   - Good at detecting outliers

2. **Hierarchical Clustering (Agglomerative)**  
   - Builds a dendrogram to represent nested clusters
   - No need to pre-specify number of clusters

3. **Mean Shift Clustering**  
   - Centroid-based algorithm that does not require the number of clusters in advance
   - Results visualized in `mean_shift_result.png`
